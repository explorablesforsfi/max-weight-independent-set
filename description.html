<h2>Maximum Weight Independent Set</h2>

<p>
In a graph whose nodes are associated with weights we want to find the
set of nodes whose cumulative weights are maximal under the following condition:
nodes in this set must not be connected by an edge. For trees, there exists an
algorithm to find this set in polynomial time. Can you find the maximum weighted set
for the tree below? How do you think the algorithm works?
